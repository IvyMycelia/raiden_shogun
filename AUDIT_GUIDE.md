## **Tips for Effective Auditing:**

3. **Follow Up**: Contact members with violations to resolve issues
4. **Document Results**: Keep track of repeat violators for disciplinary action

## **Troubleshooting:**

- **No Results**: Check if alliance has members registered
- **API Errors**: Bot will retry automatically, wait a moment
- **Missing Data**: Some members may not have complete data in API
- **Role Issues**: Ensure you have the Audit Role (ID: 1424323461446369340)

## **Best Practices:**

1. **Run audits during low-activity periods** to avoid API rate limits
2. **Use specific city filters** for warchest audits to focus on relevant members
3. **Follow up with violators** to ensure compliance
4. **Keep audit logs** for tracking member compliance over time
